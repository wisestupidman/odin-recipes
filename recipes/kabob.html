        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Kabob Koobideh, or minced meat kabob, is a traditional Iranian kabob/barbecue dish. This simple, yet flavourful dish highlights the flavours of the few ingredients. Traditionally, this dish is cooked in a "manghal" which is a rectangular, open flame barbecue. The meat is cooked using wide and long metal skewers (seekh).The key to success involves a natural,  100% wood charcoal fire/grill- no briquettes or lighter fluid. Kabob koobideh (minced meat kabob) is usually accompanied by grilled tomatoes, white rice or bread (usually pita or an Iranian bread called Sangak) , as well as dried sumac, fresh onions, and parsley.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Lean ground Beef or lamb (or a 50/50 mix of both)</li>
            <li>White Onion</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Baking Soda</li>
            <li>Tomatoes</li>
            <li>White Onions</li>
            <li>Ground Sumac</li>
            <li>Pita Bread</li>
            <li>Fresh Parsley</li>
        </ul>
        <ol>
            <li>Grate or blend the onion</li>
            <li>Thoroughly mix the grated/blended onion</li>
            <li>Add salt</li>
            <li>Add a pinch of baking soda</li>
            <li>Mix thoroughly</li>
            <li>Separate the mixture into balls that fill your hand</li>
            <li>Put each ball onto a single skewer and spread evenly to be the width of your grill</li>
            <li>Take your whole tomatoes and add a generous pinch of salt, then fit as many as you can onto your skewers</li>
            <li>Light your 100% wood coals and get them white hot</li>
            <li>Once the coals are hot and there is minimal flame, put your tomato skewers on the grill, rotate often, until there is a char on both sides - you will know when they are fully cooked when they can easily slide off the skewer</li>
            <li>Once all the tomatoes are cooked, now it is time to cook the meat skewers. The key to this is to flip often until there is a beautiful char on both sides. When the kabob skewers are cooked, you will be able to pinch them between 2 pieces of bread and the kabob will slide off</li>
            <li>Now that everything is cooked, you can make a sandwhich/wrap using the bread, the kebob, tomato, parsley, and sumac (fresh onions can be served to bite as you eat or into the sandwhich)</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
